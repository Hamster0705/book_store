The experience was so exhilarating that Bruce decided to write about it. That\'s how this extraordinary autobiography began. Over the past seven years, Bruce Springsteen has privately devoted himself to writing the story of his life, bringing to these pages the same honesty, humour and originality found in his songs. He describes growing up Catholic in Freehold, New Jersey, amid the poetry, danger and darkness that fuelled his imagination, leading up to the moment he refers to as \'The Big Bang\': seeing Elvis Presley\'s debut on The Ed Sullivan Show.

Bryan Cranston landed his first role at seven, when his father cast him in a United Way commercial. Acting was clearly the boy\'s destiny, until one day his father disappeared. Destiny suddenly took a backseat to survival. Now, in his riveting memoir, Cranston maps his zigzag journey from abandoned son to beloved star by recalling the many odd parts he\'s played in real life - paperboy, farmhand, security guard, dating consultant, murder suspect, dock loader, lover, husband, father. Cranston also chronicles his evolution on camera, from soap opera player trying to master the rules of show business to legendary character actor turning in classic performances as Seinfeld dentist Tim Whatley, \"a sadist with newer magazines,\" and Malcolm in the Middle dad Hal Wilkerson, a lovable bumbler in tighty-whities. He also gives an inspiring account of how he prepared, physically and mentally, for the challenging role of President Lyndon Johnson, a tour de force that won him a Tony to go along with his four Emmys. Of course, Cranston dives deep into the grittiest details of his greatest role, explaining how he searched inward for the personal darkness that would help him create one of the most memorable performances ever captured on screen: Walter White, chemistry teacher turned drug kingpin. Discussing his life as few men do, describing his art as few actors can, Cranston has much to say about creativity, devotion, and craft, as well as innate talent and its challenges and benefits and proper maintenance. But ultimately A Life in Parts is a story about the joy, the necessity, and the transformative power of simple hard work.','Orion Publishing Co','20 Oct 2016','English','9781409156574',288,23.33,'upload_image/6.jpg','Available'),(7,'Programming Visual Basic 2005','Jesse Liberty','17','This newest programming guide by best-selling author Jesse Liberty isn\'t your typical Visual Basic book. It\'s not a primer on the language, and it won\'t dull your brain with arguments hyping .NET either. Its goal, rather, is to make you immediately productive, creating Windows and Web applications using Visual Basic and its associated tools. Written for experienced Visual Basic programmers (from either a VB6 or VB .NET background), the book shows how Visual Basic 2005 can be used to rapidly build modern web applications and new \"Smart Client\" applications, which combine the power of individual computers with network data resources to deliver a rich interactive experience. You\'ll also learn the details of building robust object-oriented applications, and a host of especially dangerous pitfalls to avoid when programming with Visual Basic 2005. What makes this book different is what\'s not included. There\'s no introduction to Visual Basic, no explanation of how it fits into the .NET world. Why waste time reading about something you\'ll learn for yourself as soon as you start creating applications? You won\'t even write a \"Hello World\" program. With Jesse Liberty, you\'ll get started building something useful. The book is divided into three separate parts - Building Windows Applications, Building Web Applications, and Programming with Visual Basic - each of which could be a book on its own. The author shares his thorough understanding of the subject matter through lucid explanations and intelligently designed lessons that guide you to increasing levels of expertise. By the time you\'ve finished the book, you\'ll know how to program with VB 2005. Jesse Liberty\'s books have successfully guided thousands of programmers into the world of .NET programming, and \"Programming Visual Basic 2005\" will be no exception.

It teaches you how to use the APIs, tools, and tricks of XML to build real-world applications. The result is a new approach to managing information that touches everything from configuration files to web sites. After two chapters on XML basics, including XPath, XSL, DTDs, and XML Schema, the rest of the book focuses on using XML from your Java applications. This third edition of \"Java and XML\" covers all major Java XML processing libraries, including full coverage of the SAX, DOM, StAX, JDOM, and dom4j APIs as well as the latest version of the Java API for XML Processing (JAXP) and Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB). The chapters on web technology have been entirely rewritten to focus on the today\'s most relevant topics: syndicating content with RSS and creating Web 2.0 applications. You\'ll learn how to create, read, and modify RSS feeds for syndicated content and use XML to power the next generation of websites with Ajax and Adobe Flash. It includes topics such as: the basics of XML, including DTDs, namespaces, XML Schema, XPath, and Transformations; the SAX API, including all handlers, filters, and writers; the DOM API, including DOM Level 2, Level 3, and the DOM HTML module; the JDOM API, including the core and a look at XPath support; the StAX API, including StAX factories, producing documents and XMLPull; Data Binding with JAXB, using the new JAXB 2.0 annotations; Web syndication and podcasting with RSS; and, XML on the Presentation Layer, paying attention to Ajax and Flash applications.

This book is best suitable for first time C# readers, Covers all fast track topics of C# for all Computer Science students and Professionals. This book is targeted toward those who have little or no programming experience or who might be picking up C# as a second language By Best Selling Author Harry H Chaudhary. The book has been structured and written with a purpose: to get you productive as quickly as possible. I\'ve used my experiences in writing applications with C# and teaching C# to create a book that I hope cuts through the fluff and teaches you what you need to know. All too often, authors fall into the trap of focusing on the technology rather than on the practical application of the technology. I\'ve worked hard to keep this book focused on teaching you practical skills that you can apply immediately toward a development project. This book is divided into ten Chapters, each of which focuses on a different aspect of developing applications with C#. These parts generally follow the flow of tasks you\'ll perform as you begin creating your own programs with C#. I recommend that you read them in the order in which they appear. Using C#, this book develops the concepts and theory of Building the Program Logic and Interfaces analysis, Exceptions, Delegates and Events and other important things in a gradual, step-by-step manner, proceeding from concrete examples to abstract principles. Standish covers a wide range of both traditional and contemporary software engineering topics. This is a handy guide of sorts for any computer science engineering Students, Thinking In C# Programming is a solution bank for various complex problems related to C# and .NET. It can be used as a reference manual by Computer Science Engineering students. This Book also covers all aspects of B.TECH CS, IT, and BCA and MCA, BSC IT. Preview introduced programmers to a new era called functional programming. C# focused on bridging the gap between programming languages and databases. This book covers all the language features from the first version through C# . It also provides you with the essentials of using Visual Studio 2005 to let you enjoy its capabilities and save you time by using features such as IntelliSense. Learning a new programming language can be intimidating. If you\'ve never programmed before, the act of typing seemingly cryptic text to produce sleek and powerful applications probably seems like a black art, and you might wonder how you\'ll ever learn everything you need to know. The answer is, of course, one step at a time. The first step to learning a language is the same as that of any other activity: building confidence. Programming is part art and part science. Although it might seem like magic, it\'s more akin to illusion: After you know how things work a lot of the mysticism goes away, freeing you to focus on the mechanics necessary to produce any given desired result.','Createspace','02 Jun 2014','English','9781500193386',250,20.77,'upload_image/10.jpg','Available'),(11,'Java Server Programming','Inc.

A \"Sunday Times\" and \"New York Times\" Bestseller. Our lives are driven by a fact that most of us can\'t name and don\'t understand. It defines who our friends and lovers are, which careers we choose, and whether we blush when we\'re embarrassed. That fact is whether we\'re an introvert or an extrovert. The introvert/extrovert divide is the most fundamental dimension of personality. And at least a third of us are on the introverted side. Some of the world\'s most talented people are introverts. Without them we wouldn\'t have the Apple computer, the theory of relativity and Van Gogh\'s sunflowers. Yet extroverts have taken over. Shyness, sensitivity and seriousness are often seen as being negative. Introverts feel reproached for being the way they are. In \"Quiet\", Susan Cain shows how the brain chemistry of introverts and extroverts differs, and how society misunderstands and undervalues introverts. She gives introverts the tools to better understand themselves and take full advantage of their strengths.
